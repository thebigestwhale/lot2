:wave: **Hey everyone and welcome to This Week in Lotus!**

The team have returned from an amazing FILDev Summit in Singapore and have hit the ground running!!

**Welcome to the Team Jie!!  :blue_heart:**

The team were delighted to welcome @Jie to the team this week! Jie hails from California and is joining the squad as a Protocol Engineer. Please help us make him feel extra welcome by leaving a :wave: in the comments. :pray:

**Remove Existing Chain During Import:**

We have a brand new `remove-existing-chain`` flag that will soon be available in Lotus. The new flag will be enabled by default and will help to ensure that any old chain data is automatically and safely removed when importing a new snapshot. [Check out the PR link here!](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/11277)

**:mag: Monitoring Lotus Nodes:**

@Fridrik has created a new guide this week that details how to quickly and easily set up a Grafana dashboard, using Prometheus and `node_exporter` to monitor your Lotus node! Check out the instructions [link here](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/11276) and let us know your thoughts! 

**Residual File References:**

The team were made aware of a few users experiencing abnormal disk usage this week. Thanks to some amazing feedback from the community the issue was identified and resolved by our friends in the Boost Team. You can catch up with the [conversation here](https://filecoinproject.slack.com/archives/CPFTWMY7N/p1694417178294309) and the [PR here!](https://github.com/filecoin-project/boost/pull/1707)
