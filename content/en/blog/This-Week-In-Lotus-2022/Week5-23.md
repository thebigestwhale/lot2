**PeSto!**

As you may know, the Lotus team has been starting a project codenamed PeSto to explore how a smart contracts can act as a deal client, and how storage providers can take deals from these client contracts!

We published our first walkthrough in the [smart contract as a deal client series here](https://pl-strflt.notion.site/Smart-Contract-as-a-Client-Part-I-b939f665adb242528299d995793fbfe4). We highly recommend both developers and storage providers to check out the video.

**Enhancements/fixes:**

- A PR has been updated to add the add the ability to extract data from sectors from a running lotus-miner deployment. [The PR is currently in review here.](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/10169)
- With the upcoming network upgrade you will be able to create fevm (f410) addresses with the `lotus wallet new` command. A PR to make that [clear in the arguments have been opened](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/10179). If you want to learn more about the f4-address class [you can read through the f4-address FIP.](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/discussions/473)
- A fix to allow f4-addresses to send to any address has been opened. [The PR has is currently in review](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/10160) and will be added to the upcoming release/v1.20.0 branch.
- Additional cleanup of some lotus-miner commands that where missing `ArgsUsage` [in their help text has been merged.](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/10147)

We are currently looking into a couple of different ideas for optimizing network migrations to make the upgrade process more graceful. We will come back with more information and enhancements in the next weeks.

Thatâ€™s it for the week! **Have a great weekend!** :sunny:
