**Lotus Releases**
The team will be publishing two Lotus releases before the upcoming upgrade and the first release candidate [Lotus v.1.24.0-rc1](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/releases/tag/v1.24.0-rc1) landed this week! Check out the [release notes here.](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/releases/tag/v1.24.0-rc1)

Upcoming Lotus Releases:

After further Calibration testing, the final release is targeted for October 31st.

**For users who will be upgrading directly from an earlier version of Lotus such as v1.22.0, please note the following important changes that have taken place in interim releases**

- For users opting to upgrade to the new Lotus v1.24.0 release train
   - A minimum Go version of `v1.19.12` or higher is now required to successfully build Lotus. Go version 1.20 is also supported, but 1.21 is NOT - [ref v1.23.3](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/releases/tag/v1.23.3)
- For users opting to upgrade to the new Lotus v1.25.0 release train
   - Please remove and clone a new Lotus repo (git clone https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus.git) when upgrading to this version
   - A minimum Go version of `v1.20.7` or higher is now required to successfully build Lotus. Go version 1.21 is NOT supported - ref [v1.23.4-rc2](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/releases/tag/v1.23.4-rc2)
-  The SplitStore feature is now enabled by default on all new nodes. For existing users, the Lotus node will now fail to start unless the `EnableSplitstore` config setting is explicitly set to either `true` or `false` prior to daemon start - ref v1.23.0
- The proofs libraries now have CUDA enabled by default which will require a [fully functional CUDA installation.](https://lotus.filecoin.io/tutorials/lotus-miner/cuda/) Users can still opt to use OpenCL instead by setting the `FFI_USE_OPENCL=1` when building from source or disable GPU usage entirely by setting the `FFI_USE_GPU=0` flag - ref v1.23.0
- The `lotus-miner sectors renew` command has been deprecated and all functionality moved to the lotus-miner sectors extend command.
- Exchanges/Node operators/RPC providers please note that Execution traces have changed to account for changes introduced by the FVM. Please make sure to read the`Execution trace format` change section at this link for full details - ref [v1.23.0](http://the%20splitstore%20feature%20is%20automatically%20activated%20on%20new%20nodes./)
