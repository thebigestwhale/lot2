**FIP-0045 & Gas Fees**

The Lotus Team received a few questions this week about [FIP-0045's](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0045.md) effect on `PublishStorageDeals` messages and FIL+ message batching. You can read more about the increase in PSD message fees [here](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0045.md#gas-costs) and the numerous initiatives currently underway to significantly improve gas fees [here.](https://github.com/filecoin-project/builtin-actors/issues/1020) :+1:

The Lotus Team is currently recommending that storage providers temporarily disable batching for ProveCommitSector messages for sectors containing verified deals.

If you have any further questions, suggestions or feedback about current gas fees, please reach out to the Actors Team team in the #fil-actors channel on Slack.

Our most excellent friends over in Boost land announced that they will be disabling payments via built-in payment channels actor by default this week. Please make sure to [check out the full post](https://filecoinproject.slack.com/archives/C0328PT17JR/p1684438156961149) and update your configs accordingly if required.
