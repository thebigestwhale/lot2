**Network Version 21 - Watermelon - Scope & Timeline Update**

In last week's update, we outlined the difficulties encountered while [integrating FIP-0070](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0070.md) into the upcoming Network Version 21 upgrade. To tackle these challenges, [the governance team initiated a decision matrix](https://www.notion.so/pl-strflt/nv21-decision-matrix-for-FIP0070-bug-a39174216ee1479eab9a55b2f23da520), enabling our teams to thoroughly investigate the issues and provide a clear path forward.

Following several days of intense discussion, we're now able to reveal the revised scope and timeline for the Watermelon NV21 upgrade. You might have already noticed this announcement in the `#fil-lotus-announcement` channel recently.

- :hammer_and_wrench: **FIP-0070 Update -** We've decided to [descope FIP-0070](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0070.md) from the upcoming :watermelon: NV21 upgrade, prioritizing the security and stability of the network. But don't worry, FIP-0070 is still on the way! Our FIP authors and implementers are refining its design and implementation and you can look forward to seeing it in a future upgrade. Stay tuned! :radio:
- **Mainnet upgrade timeline -** The Mainnet upgrade will now be taking place at `epoch 3469380` which falls on the **12th of December 2023 at 01:30 PM UTC.**

**:rotating_light: Attention Calibrator Crew!! :rotating_light:**

Heads up, team Calibration! The various implementation teams have also decided to perform another minor CodeCID migration on the Calibration network. This is to completely remove all remnants of the now-descoped FIP-0070 from the v12 actor code and fully align our Calibration testnet with the new scope for NV21 on Mainnet! This also means more Calibration testing time before :watermelon: NV21 officially lands!! :airplane_arriving:

**:eyes: This new migration will be taking place on Calibration at epoch 1108174, which falls on Tuesday, November the 21st 2023, at 01:00PM UTC.**

:warning: All Calibration operators should be running a minimum of [Lotus v1.24.0-rc6](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/releases/tag/v1.24.0-rc6) or [v1.25.0-rc5](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/releases/tag/v1.25.0-rc5) prior to the Calibration migration on Tuesday in order to maintain uninterrupted operations! :warning:

**Lotus Releases Update**

Lotus versions [v1.24.0-rc6](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/releases/tag/v1.24.0-rc6) and [v1.25.0-rc5](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/releases/tag/v1.25.0-rc5) have now officially landed! Please check out the detailed release notes for all the juicy info!

The team is now aiming to publish **final releases of v1.24.0 and v1.25.0 on the 23rd of November 2023**, which gives node operators over 2 weeks to update their nodes before the Mainnet upgrade on the 12th of December!

Thatâ€™s it for the week! **Have a great weekend!** :sunny:
