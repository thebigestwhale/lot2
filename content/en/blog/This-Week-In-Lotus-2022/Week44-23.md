**Network Version 21 - Watermelon - Timeline Update**

**Mainnet upgrade:** `Epoch 3431940` on Wednesday the 29th of November at 13:30 UTC.

**Calibrationeers, Operation rotten watermelon:**

The implementer teams (Venus, Lotus, Forest) has decided to patch the Calibration network, fixing the issue where partitions with expired sectors needed to be compacted before they can be moved ([more details here](https://github.com/filecoin-project/builtin-actors/pull/1455)).

Fortunately, we caught it on the Testnet before it’s launched on Mainnet! And unfortunately, to fix this bug on calibration needs an upgrade as it is a consensus breaking change.

**Calibration upgrade:** `Epoch 1070494` on Thursday the 19th of October at approximately 13:00 UTC.

We ask all the calibration network operators and storage providers to update to the new release candidates as soon as possible and continue testing!
- [v1.24.0-rc4](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/releases/tag/v1.24.0-rc4)
- [v1.25.0-rc3](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/releases/tag/v1.25.0-rc3)

*Feel free to reach out in `#fil-net-calibration-discuss` if you have any question!*

**Last Call for FIP0074 & FIP0079 :bell:**

After several months of deliberation, feedback, and design changes, the following FIPs are in Last Call:

- **FIP0074 - Remove cron-based automatic deal settlement:** This FIP proposes to add a method to the built-in market actor to allow storage providers to settle deal payments manually.

- **FIP0079 - Add BLS Aggregate Signatures to FVM:** This FIP proposes the addition of a syscall for BLS aggregate signature verification and the removal of the syscall currently used for generic signature (i.e. Secp256k1 and non-aggregate BLS) validation, and refactoring of its associated SDK function in terms of existing Secp256k1 signature syscalls and the added aggregate BLS syscall.
