:wave: **Hey everyone and welcome to This Week in Lotus!**

Many from the community has been gathering in Austin, for the FIL Austin event this week. We hope everyone who attended had a good time. It looked like a jam-packed event with many exciting talks and side events.

**Network 16 updates:**
- Testing on the :butterfly: network has concluded, and the preparational work for upgrading the calibration network has started. Join the `#fil-net-calibration-discuss` channel and subscribe to [network reports here](https://status.filecoin.io) to stay in the loop about the calibration network upgrade timeline.
- If you are testing the preliminary `release/v1.16.0` version on mainnet, the environment variable for syncing using the FVM has changed from `LOTUS_USE_FVM_EXPERIMENTAL` to `LOTUS_USE_FVM_TO_SYNC_MAINNET_V15`.

**Bug fixes:**
- For a very brief moment there where some issues building a local 2k-network. It was [fixed super fast](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/8835) and everything builds fine now. :building_construction:
- A couple of smaller UX-enhancements has been merged to improve error messages, and better communicate that some commands are waiting for confirmation on-chain.
