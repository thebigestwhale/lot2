:wave: **Hey everyone and welcome to This Week in Lotus!**

Before you read on, we would love to hear from you about how things are going! How can we help you meet your goals over the next 6 months and what Lotus can do to help you achieve that goal? We´d be extremely grateful for a moment of your time to complete the [Lotus Pulse survey](https://forms.gle/yPNpQZ5uZR3Yzu1b9)!

**Network 16 updates:**
- The Calibration network upgraded at epoch height `1044660`, 2022-06-16T17:30:00 UTC. The upgrade was a success, and marks a big milestone for the upgrade since this was the first nv16-upgrade on a network with multiple implementations :rocket:
- We have a date :calendar: for the mainnet nv16 upgrade!!!! It is scheduled to upgrade at epoch `1960320`, 2022-07-06T14:00:00Z (10am EST). Check out the [full post here](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/discussions/74?sort=new#discussioncomment-2965298).

**Notable reminders:**
- The Lotus sealing code is currently being refactored. [Part 1 - storage refactors](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/8858) and [Part 3](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/8879) has been merged. [Part 2](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/8871) is currently in review.
- A command to [propose and approve](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/8865) a multi-signature owner account withdrawal without using lotus-shed is currently in review.

The Lotus Team has now a public [Lotus Roadmap](https://pl-strflt.notion.site/LOTUS-ROADMAP-2ab7bcc9c9344a29b50eeef926e63ba7). We are still adding some things to the page :building_construction:.  We recommend you take an extra look at Lotus Project section to see what we plan to work on in the coming quarters, and all the things that are in the pipeline.

That’s it for the week! **Have a great weekend!** :sunny:
