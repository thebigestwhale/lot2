The team has been continuing to :eyes: on resolving the daemon sync issues that some users have been seeing and we have made some great progress! We are currently investigating :sleuth_or_spy: a potential link to pool message volume that is particularly apparent during rapid snap-deal onboarding. The amazing feedback we have received on numerous platforms has been combined and collected in a [new discussion thread](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/discussions/10907) and we are continuing to track the issue [here.](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/issues/10906) Your feedback and logs are incredibly useful, please continue to update the issue thread with any new information.

One of the topics of [discussion](https://filecoinproject.slack.com/archives/C0328PT17JR/p1684910753827809) this week has been **security** and more specifically Storage Provider node security! Whilst [the conversation](https://filecoinproject.slack.com/archives/C0328PT17JR/p1684910753827809) started with our friends over in Boost, we realise that security is a crucial concern for all components that an SP utilises in the running of their operations. We would :blue_heart: to hear your feedback, comments & suggestions on this important topic!! Also, be sure to check out the Filecoin [Bug Bounty Program](https://security.filecoin.io/bug-bounty/), it would be awesome to see some of these rewards going to members of our Lotus community!

**Protocol Development:** The Lotus Team is currently working with the Interplanetary Consensus (IPC) Team from ConsensusLab to help bring subnets to mainnet! You can learn more about IPC at ipc.space and don't forget to check out their fantastic [Welcome to Interplanetary Consensus!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRyj9kOvW7I) video.

**Snap Deals:** SPs have been asking for enhanced snap-deal sector selection tooling since the FIP-0045 activation and the team is making some great progress. [10923](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/10923) & [10915](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/10915) will bring improved visualizations and sector selection logic to the snap-deal onboarding process.

*Reminder:* The Lotus Team will be in Austin from the 5th to the 9th of June 2023! We are very much looking forward to welcoming Texan SPs to the conversation!

Please reach out in `#fil-lotus-help` if you are n the Austin area in early June and would like to join us!!

Thatâ€™s it for the week! **Have a great weekend!** :sunny:
