**Watermelon Has Arrived**
Network Version 21 went live on Mainnet at [Epoch 3469380](https://filfox.info/en/tipset/3469380) on the 12th of December 2023 at 13:30 UTC and we are already seeing SPs taking advantage of the new [Synthetic PoRep feature](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0059.md) as a growing number of `PreCommitSectorBatch2` are appearing on-chain! Additionally, Storage Providers are eagerly utilizing the [new 3.5-year maximum sector durations](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0052.md) that landed with the upgrade!

*Remember:*
- You can enable [Synthetic PoRep](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0059.md) on your own SP operations by simply setting `UseSyntheticPoRep = true` in your miner `config.toml`!
- If you would like to change the default duration of your freshly squeezed CC sectors to leverage the new [3.5-year sector terms](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0052.md), just change the `CommittedCapacitySectorLifetime` setting in your miner `config.toml`.

**Lotus Releases Update**
Lotus versions and [v1.24.](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/releases/tag/v1.24.1) and [v1.25.1](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/releases/tag/v1.25.1) landed a few days in direct response to syncing issues caused by a rapid increase in the number of messages on the network over the weekend! Please check out the detailed release notes for more information!
Lotus [v1.24.1](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/releases/tag/v1.24.1) and [v1.25.1](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/releases/tag/v1.25.1) are highly recommended but optional patch releases! The team also released [v.1.25.2-rc1](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/releases/tag/v1.25.2-rc1) which includes the message volume mitigation as well as the new Lotus Provider alpha and SupraSeal PC2 optimisations that the [team announced last week.](https://filecoinproject.slack.com/archives/C027TQMUVJN/p1702053984695599)

*Please make sure to read all of the new release notes thoroughly before any upgrades on your systems!*

The team are also currently working with a small group of Storage Providers who are still experiencing unrelated random and intermittent sync loss on some of their nodes. A huge thank you to all the SPs who have made a massive effort to engage with the team and provide logs and feedback! Mitigations are being actively tested as we speak! Please keep monitoring #fil-lotus-help for updates and let us know if you experience any extended episodes of sync loss on your own nodes!

**Calling all Ecosystem Node Operators!!**
We [recently announced](https://filecoinproject.slack.com/archives/C01AC6999KQ/p1702655688246009) the launch of the new [Node Operator Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScpkM9Rr81d_9m7pNXK1u8CnyvONQLGbrHzzUcfgOQbARl4Tw/viewform), led by our friends in the Forest Team! This is a unique opportunity for you to share your insights and experiences!
