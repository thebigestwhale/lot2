:wave: **Hey everyone and welcome to This Week in Lotus!**

Many of the Lotus team members has been taking a couple of well deserved days off this week, so this weeks update will be a bit shorter :beach_with_umbrella::swimmer: Most of the focus for the team this week has been on more internal LotusY things, as well as testing new upcoming features.

If you have not seen it yet, we highly recommend you check out the Filecoin Roadmap :round_pushpin: presentation held in Paris last week. [Watch it here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXkUVp16xZ4)

We also encourage people to check out the Lotus roadmap, [which you can find here.](https://pl-strflt.notion.site/LOTUS-ROADMAP-2ab7bcc9c9344a29b50eeef926e63ba7)

Thatâ€™s it for the week! **Have a great weekend!** :sunny:
