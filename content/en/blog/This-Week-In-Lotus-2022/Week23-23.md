**:ship: v1.23.1-rc4**

The fourth release candidate of the Lotus v1.23.1 release was published this week. Most notably it backports:
- Updating the go-libp2p dependency to 0.27.5.
- A fix for RPC node operators experiencing a syncing issue when GetTipsetByHeight was called with a negative value.

**:male-detective: Syncing issue <> Libp2p team**

We are currently back in triage mode for the syncing issues observed in #10906 after the fixes we worked on for the suspected root causes did not fix the issue.

We’re currently engaging with the libp2p team for items we find suspicious. However, this probably means that a final fix will be further delayed and potentially not be included in the upcoming v1.23.1 release.

We will come back with further findings from our investigation with the Libp2p-team.

**FilDev colo**

The Lotus team gathered together with the rest of FilDev this week to plan our goals for the next quarters. We will share our roadmap with the community when the milestones have been finalized, we think all our users will be excited for what is coming!

That’s it for the week! **Have a great weekend!** :sunny:
