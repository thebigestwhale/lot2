## Problem:

When installing Lotus for mainnet, lotus-wallet is not installed by default. 

## Environment:

- Mainnet

## Resolution:

After lotus installs (completely) run `make install lotus-wallet`

## Extras:

Note that lotus-wallet is not required for lotus to run on the network. It only contains a tool for running a remote lotus wallet application.
