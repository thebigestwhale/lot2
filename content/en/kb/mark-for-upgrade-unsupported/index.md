The `lotus-miner sectors mark-for-upgrade` command which allowed you to mark committed capacity sectors for replacement by a sector with deals has been unsupported, as of Lotus v1.15.0. ItÂ´s replaced by the `lotus-miner sectors snap-up` command, which allows you to mark committed capacity sectors to be filled with deals instead. Learn more about [Snap-deals here]({{< relref "../../storage-providers/operate/snap-deals/" >}}).
